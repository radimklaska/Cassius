# Cassius
Cassius is naive (and dumb) Windows script that backs up CEZAR ([Caesar], http://www.cezar.cz/) to Dropbox.

# Usage
* Read the script.
* Update paths to CEZAR and Dropbox.
* Run it.
* Script creates new folder with current date and time. Copy of CEZAR will be inside.

# Other Notes
* Messages are in Czech language because the software itself does not have any other localization.

# Why Cassius?
* Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare, Act 1, Scene 2: When a young Caesar double-dog-dared Cassius, his childhood friend, to swim across the Tiber River, it nearly cost Caesar his life.  Cassius saved the "wretched creature" from drowning.
* The name is probably more interesting than the script itself. Git FTW!
